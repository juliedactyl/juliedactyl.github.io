<h1>About Julie</h1>
<p>I am originally from Norway, but am currently based in Dublin, Ireland. In 2022 I completed my Master's in Nanotechnology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), and if you're interested you can find my thesis <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11250/3034272">here</a>. </p>


<p>After many wonderful years in Trondheim I embarked on the PhD journey of a lifetime, and I am now happily working in the Ultramicroscopy group at Trinity College Dublin. Supervised by the brilliant Prof. Lewys Jones, I'm working with detector signal digitisation for ultra low-dose phase contrast imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy. </p>


<p>When I'm not busy thinking about my work, I enjoy various kinds of sports and outdoor activities including trampolining, running and hiking. Still, my number 1 hobby for years is photography. </p>
